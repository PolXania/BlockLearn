# **BlockLearn: A Decentralized Learning Analytics Platform on Ethereum**

**BlockLearn** is a decentralized platform that allows students and professionals to showcase their skills, achievements, and learning progress on the Ethereum blockchain. This project leverages blockchain technology to provide a secure, transparent, and immutable record of a user’s educational journey, similar to a LinkedIn but decentralized.

## **Introduction**

BlockLearn is designed to enable users to create profiles, add skills and achievements, and share them on a blockchain-powered platform. By decentralizing learning analytics, BlockLearn ensures that users have control over their data while providing a transparent and immutable way to showcase their educational growth.

---

## **Features**

- **Decentralized Profile Management**: Create and update profiles that store your name, skills, and achievements on the blockchain.
- **Skill and Achievement Tracking**: Add skills and achievements to your profile in a verifiable and transparent manner.
- **Profile Retrieval by Name**: Search and retrieve profiles by typing the student’s name, eliminating the need to know wallet addresses.
- **Tamper-Proof Data**: Profiles, skills, and achievements are stored immutably on the blockchain, ensuring trust and authenticity.

---

## **How It Works**

1. **Profile Creation**: Users create or update their profiles by providing a unique name.
2. **Adding Skills and Achievements**: Users can continually add skills and achievements to showcase their learning progress.
3. **Retrieving Profiles**: Profiles can be retrieved using either the user’s Ethereum address or their unique name.

The project uses Ethereum’s smart contract functionality to manage profiles, skills, and achievements in a decentralized way.

---

## **Technology Stack**

- **Solidity**: Programming language for writing smart contracts.
- **Remix IDE**: Browser-based IDE for developing, deploying, and testing smart contracts.
- **Ethereum Blockchain**: The decentralized platform where the smart contract is deployed.

---

## **Smart Contract Details**

The core functionality is managed by a Solidity smart contract with the following key components:

1. **Profile Struct**:
    - Stores the user's name, skills, and achievements.

2. **Mappings**:
    - `mapping(address => Profile) profiles`: Maps user addresses to their profiles.
    - `mapping(string => address) nameToAddress`: Maps a user's name to their Ethereum address.

3. **Functions**:
    - **createOrUpdateProfile**: Creates or updates a profile with a unique name.
    - **addSkill**: Adds a skill to the user’s profile.
    - **addAchievement**: Adds an achievement to the user’s profile.
    - **getProfileByName**: Retrieves a profile by typing the user’s name.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Remix IDE**: [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
- **MetaMask Wallet**: [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)
- **Node.js and npm**: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Not done yet)

### **Installation and Setup**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/BlockLearn.git
    cd BlockLearn
    ```

2. **Open Remix IDE**:
    - Visit [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
    - Import the `BlockLearn.sol` file into your workspace.

3. **Compile the Contract**:
    - In Remix, navigate to the “Solidity Compiler” tab and compile the `BlockLearn.sol` file.

4. **Deploy the Contract**:
    - Go to the “Deploy & Run Transactions” tab.
    - Select the appropriate environment (e.g., `Injected Web3` for MetaMask).
    - Deploy the contract.

5. **Interact with the Contract**:
    - Use the deployed contract interface in Remix to create profiles, add skills, achievements, and retrieve profiles.

## **Project Structure**

The project consists of the following files:

- **`BlockLearn.sol`**: The main Solidity smart contract containing the core functionality.
- **`README.md`**: Detailed documentation for the project.
- **`LICENSE`**: License file.

---

## **Deployment**

For deployment, you can use Remix IDE with the following steps:

1. Connect your MetaMask wallet to Remix.
2. Choose the “Injected Web3” environment.
3. Deploy the contract on a test network (e.g., Rinkeby, Goerli) or the Ethereum mainnet.

---

## **Future Enhancements**

BlockLearn is a foundational project with a lot of potential. Future enhancements could include:

- **Decentralized Badges and Certificates**: Allow institutions to issue verifiable certificates on the blockchain.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Add access control mechanisms to allow certain users to verify and endorse skills.
- **Interoperability with Other Platforms**: Integrate with other blockchain platforms to increase data portability.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Build a dashboard to visualize skill development over time.
