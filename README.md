# BlockLearn: Decentralized Learning Analytics on Ethereum

## Vision
BlockLearn is a decentralized platform for managing and sharing student profiles, skills, and achievements in a transparent, trustless environment. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, BlockLearn offers a secure and tamper-proof method for showcasing learning progress while promoting data privacy and ownership.

## Flowchart
```text
[User Interaction] --> [Smart Contract] --> [Blockchain Data Storage]
```
1. Users create or update profiles with their name.
2. Skills and achievements are added securely to the blockchain.
3. Profiles are retrieved using the student's name.

## Smart Contract Address
0x24d8de8bc502907642c79c03c98bff519db91034

## Features
- **Decentralized Profile Creation**: Each user has a unique profile mapped by their name.
- **Skill and Achievement Tracking**: Users can securely add their skills and achievements to their profile.
- **Name-Based Profile Retrieval**: Anyone can fetch profiles using the user’s name for quick access.

## How It Works
1. **Profile Creation/Update**: Users can create or update profiles with their name. The contract ensures each name is unique.
2. **Skill & Achievement Addition**: Users can add skills and achievements to their profile.
3. **Profile Retrieval by Name**: Retrieve profile information by simply providing the student’s name.

## Future Scope
1. **Verified Credentials**: Integrate with educational institutions for issuing verified certificates on-chain.
2. **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control to allow educators or mentors to endorse profiles.
3. **Analytics Dashboard**: Create a dashboard to visualize a user’s skill growth and learning progress.
4. **Badge System**: Issue blockchain-backed digital badges for significant achievements.
